## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Current Security Features

The NAS Setup Script includes several security measures:

- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **SSH Hardening:** Ed25519 key generation and secure configurations
- **Firewall Management:** IPv4/IPv6 firewall rules with UFW/Firewalld
- **Intrusion Detection:** Fail2ban integration for brute-force protection
- **Audit Logging:** System auditing with auditd
- **Access Control:** Mandatory Access Control (AppArmor/SELinux)
- **Secure Defaults:** Conservative security settings by default
- **Distribution Detection:** Robust 5-method fallback system with container environment detection
- **Version Validation:** Advanced regex parsing and bc calculator for precise version comparisons
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive test suite (66+ test cases) ensuring code reliability
- **Container Security:** Detection and warnings for Docker/Podman/LXC/WSL environments

### Known Limitations

- **Root Access Required:** The script requires root/sudo privileges for system configuration
- **Network Dependencies:** Internet access required for package downloads
- **Service Exposure:** Configured services may expose ports to networks
- **User Responsibility:** End users are responsible for their network security

## üîß Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions following semantic versioning:
- **Critical vulnerabilities:** Immediate patch release
- **High severity:** Within 7 days
- **Medium/Low severity:** Included in next minor release

## üìö Best Practices for Users

### Before Installation
- Review the code and understand what the script does
- Test in a virtualized environment first
- Backup important data before running
- Ensure you have console access in case of issues

### After Installation
- Change default passwords immediately
- Review firewall rules and service configurations
- Monitor system logs regularly
- Keep the system updated with security patches
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services

### Network Security
- Place the NAS in a secure network segment
- Use VPN for remote access when possible
- Implement network segmentation
- Regularly audit network access logs

## üè∑Ô∏è Vulnerability Classification

We use the following severity levels:

- **Critical:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data loss
- **High:** Authentication bypass, significant data exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, DoS attacks
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact
